My SQL notes
SQL is a language to get values and tables from a database.
It consists of rows and columns as usual with other database tools.
SELECT:
    SELECT is used to retrive information from the specified columns
    SELECT * means retrive all FROM(specifies the position where the data will come from)
        SELECT market_date, vendor_id, booth_number #gets these columns
        FROM farmers_market.vendor_booth_assignments #from this table
        LIMIT 5  #gets/showcases the first 5 values
ORDER BY:
    The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the output rows. In it, you list the columns 
    you want to sort the results by, in order, separated by commas. You can also 
    specify whether you want the sorting to be in ascending (ASC) or descending 
    (DESC) order.
        SELECT product_id, product_name
        FROM farmers_market.product
        ORDER BY product_name #Sort by the name
        LIMIT 5
    We can do a specified series of orderings
        SELECT market_date, vendor_id, booth_number 
        FROM farmers_market.vendor_booth_assignments
        ORDER BY market_date, vendor_id #first by date and then for the vendor id
        LIMIT 5
